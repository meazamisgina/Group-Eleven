PROCESS:
    1. Initialize restaurant with tables and empty reservation/waitlist lists.
    2. When a reservation request is received:
        Check for available tables matching party size, time, and preferences.
        If a suitable table is available:
            - Assign the table to the guest.
            - Mark the table as reserved for that time slot.
            - Create a Reservation object (status = CONFIRMED).
        If no table available:
            - Add the guest to the waitlist with their preferences.
            - Create a Reservation object (status = WAITLISTED).
    3. For walk-in guests:
        - Attempt to make an immediate reservation as above.
    4. When guests arrive:
        Check reservation status.
        If confirmed or if table becomes free, seat the guest and update the status.
    5. When a reservation is cancelled:
         Free up the table.
        Check waitlist for guests who can now be accommodated, assign table if possible.
    6. Optimize table turnover during peak hours:

        Prioritize VIPs or key guests as needed.
